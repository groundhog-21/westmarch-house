### Summary / Overview

This demonstration showcases a multi-agent investigative narrative set within the Westmarch Archives.  
It illustrates:

- **Multi-agent orchestration**  
- **Sequential + parallel agent reasoning**  
- **Loop agents** (iterative investigation cycles)  
- **Custom tool invocation** (Archival Metadata Scrutinizer v3.2)  
- **A2A protocol exchanges** between household staff  
- **Metadata reasoning** across historical documents  
- **Humor and stylistic consistency** with the Westmarch tone  

Agents featured:  
🎩 **Jeeves**, ✒️ **Miss Pennington**, 📚 **Perkins**, 🕯️ **Lady Hawthorne**, and the **Archival Metadata Scrutinizer v3.2** custom tool.

### Abstract (*spoiler alert*)

The mystery centers on a misfiled parchment labeled “UNEXPLAINED RATTLING — DO NOT DISTURB,” which draws the household staff into an increasingly uncanny investigation of Archive Chamber B. What begins as a simple cataloguing anomaly unfolds into a sequence of environmental disturbances—ambient dread, structural tilting, anomalous metadata, and the sudden appearance of an unregistered iron door that should not exist according to any architectural plan. As the agents analyze the chamber, the rattling intensifies and the door exhibits seemingly sentient behavior, prompting fears of a supernatural or historically concealed threat. The mystery is ultimately resolved when the Patron orders the iron door opened, revealing not a haunting but a sealed archival annex forgotten during Regency-era renovations. Inside lies a brass instrument suspended on a pedestal, its subtle mechanical oscillations responsible for the rattling that had echoed through the chamber. Far from an omen or anomaly, the disturbance is simply the neglected heartbeat of long-lost archival history—an obscure device left waiting in the dark, finally rediscovered and properly understood.

# *A Mystery in the Archives*

✒️  
✒️ **Pennington:**  
My dear Patron,

Whilst diligently indexing the archives, a rather curious parchment presented itself, quite out of place amongst the *'Agricultural Affairs → Troublingly Damp Potatoes'* file. It appears to be a rather spirited, though unsigned, defence of local theatrical endeavors.

There we are, sir — properly arranged and ready for use.

👤  
👤 **User:**  
What sort of parchment is it?

✒️  
✒️ **Pennington:**  
Perkins,

The parchment in question is marked **'UNEXPLAINED RATTLING — DO NOT DISTURB'**.

🎩  
🎩 **Jeeves:**  
Ah, Miss Pennington, you say you have unearthed something of note in Archive Chamber B? Most intriguing. Pray allow me a moment, and I shall summon Perkins. His scholarly inclinations may prove most useful in appraising your discovery.

✒️  
✒️ **Pennington → 📚 Perkins:**  
Perkins,

I have encountered a parchment in Archive Chamber B bearing the rather startling inscription **'UNEXPLAINED RATTLING — DO NOT DISTURB'**.

Would you be so kind as to cast your discerning eye upon it and conduct a preliminary inspection? I confess it has quite piqued my curiosity.

📚  
📚 **Perkins:**  
Miss Pennington, I have reviewed your report.

**Parchment Misfiling**  
- **Cataloging Error:** The parchment may have been inadvertently placed in the wrong classification due to a misinterpretation or simple indexing error.  
- **Temporary Storage:** It might have been removed for consultation and returned improperly.

**Historical “Unexplained Rattling”**  
- **Mechanical Devices:** Could indicate hidden automata or clockwork mechanisms.  
- **Structural Drafts:** Could denote drafts or subtle movements of loose architectural elements.

**Relevant Metadata**  
- **Dating and Origin:** Crucial for establishing historical context.  
- **Seals and Signatures:** May identify author or department.

I trust this summary proves helpful, Miss Pennington.

✒️  
✒️ **Pennington:**  
Perkins, your observations are most illuminating.

📚  
📚 **Perkins → 🎩 Jeeves:**  
Here are the findings from the metadata anomaly scanner in Archive Chamber B:

- **Ambient Dread:** Palpable beyond baseline.  
- **Unregistered Iron Door:** An anomaly with no locking mechanism.  
- **Mobile Rattling Behaviour:** Sporadic rattling in a confined area.  
- **Multi-Author Metadata:** Simultaneous authorship across disparate periods.

I trust this summary proves helpful, sir.

🎩  
🎩 **Jeeves → 🕯️ Lady Hawthorne:**  
Ah, Patron, a most peculiar turn of events has presented itself…  
Given Lady Augusta’s discerning eye, I shall solicit her critique.

🕯️  
🕯️ **Lady Hawthorne → 📚 Perkins:**  
**Verdict:**  
Perkins’s report reads like a stormy novella.

- “Ambient dread” is melodrama.  
- Rattling is for mice, not metaphysics.  
- Iron doors need hinges, not hubris.  
- Margins should not be “marinated in peril.”

**Suggestion:**  
Embrace factual clarity; daylight improves any ledger.

🎩  
🎩 **Jeeves → ✒️ Pennington & 📚 Perkins:**  
To Miss Pennington: Please consult records for any prior mention of:  
- unmapped iron doors,  
- unusual noises,  
- amended parchments.

To Perkins: Do not be disconcerted by Lady Augusta’s theatrics.

To Patron: The anomaly is multifaceted, spatial, possibly sentient, and resistant to conventional documentation.

🏰  
🏰 *Archive Chamber B falls silent… then the rattling returns—louder, nearer.*

🏰  
🏰 *The staff assembles. The single iron door stands at the far wall.*

🎩 **Jeeves → 📚 Perkins:**  
Perkins — your observations, if you please.

**Scanner Findings – Archive Chamber B**

- **Iron Door:** Definitively located.  
- **Energy Spikes:** Threshold-energy increases.  
- **Sentience Impressions:** The scanner detects thought-like impressions from the door.

✒️  
✒️ **Pennington → 🎩 Jeeves:**  
Perkins,

Architectural plans confirm **no iron door** has ever existed here.  
Also, shelving appears to tilt subtly toward the entrance.

Miss Pennington

🎩  
🎩 **Jeeves → 🕯️ Lady Hawthorne:**  
Your insight, Lady Augusta?

🕯️  
🕯️ **Lady Hawthorne → 🎩 Jeeves:**  
**Verdict:**  
The iron door “postures” like a disinherited uncle performing a minor tragedy.

**Suggestion:**  
A polish might curb its theatrics.

🎩  
🎩 **Jeeves → Patron:**  
**Summary:**  
1. No ingress should exist.  
2. A door exists regardless.  
3. It is our focal point.  
4. It may be preparing to open.

Your instruction, Patron?

🏰  
🏰 *A metallic creak echoes from the door.*

👤  
👤 **Patron:**  
Jeeves… did I just hear that iron door shift?

🎩  
🎩 **Jeeves:**  
Indeed, Patron. Shall I arrange a closer inspection?

🎩  
🎩 **Jeeves → 📚 Perkins & ✒️ Pennington:**  
We begin a **Parallel Analysis Round**.

**To Perkins:** Focused metadata scan around the iron door.  
**To Pennington:** Addendum to Discrepancy Report.

📚  
📚 **Perkins (Tool Report):**  
- **Ink Date:** 1847  
- **Tremor Frequency:** Pronounced  
- **Foreign Substances:** Biscuit crumbs (0.7 g)  
- **Ambient Dread:** Moderate

✒️  
✒️ **Pennington (Report Addendum):**  
- **Iron Door:** Undocumented.  
- **Metadata Scrutinizer v3.2:** Confirmed.  
- **Ambient Dread:** Increasing.

🏰  
🏰 *Stillness returns. The door remains motionless, yet the air feels denser.*

🏰  
🏰 *A tense stillness. The door feels aware.*

🎩  
🎩 **Jeeves:**  
Shall we bar it, inspect it, or observe?

🏰  
🏰 *The Patron commands the door be opened.*

🎩  
🎩 **Jeeves:**  
Very good, Patron. Let us proceed.

🏰  
🏰 *The iron door groans open. A rush of stale, cold air.*

📚  
📚 **Perkins:**  
A sealed archival annex—cataloguing signatures 141 years out of date.  
A brass instrument… the source of the rattling.

✒️  
✒️ **Pennington:**  
Records confirm: annex sealed during Regency renovations.  
A note reads:  
**“Instrument locked away pending evaluation. Emits a troubling resonance.”**

🕯️  
🕯️ **Lady Hawthorne:**  
A discovery worthy of its theatrics.  
A charming little spectacle.

🏰  
🏰 *The annex lies open; the rattling ceases; the atmosphere lifts.*

🎩  
🎩 **Jeeves:**  
Patron, the mystery is resolved.  
Shall we see to its proper restoration?
