# 2. Welcome to the Estate

Pray, step through the carved oak doors.  
Within these venerable walls, your household staff stand at the ready — polished, poised, and quite incapable of refusing a request (no matter how whimsical).

Every operation you perform in the Streamlit interface is interpreted as a **summons**.  
The moment you choose a mode, the staff assemble like clockwork to attend you:

- 🎩 **Jeeves** — the unflappable butler who routes all matters with immaculate judgment  
- 📚 **Perkins** — the scholarly valet who produces investigations with an alarming thoroughness  
- ✒️ **Miss Pennington** — the secretary who makes even chaotic notes appear respectable  
- 🕯️ **Lady Hawthorne** — whose critiques, though devastating, are always framed with elegance  

The sidebar is your *keys to the Estate*. Choose a service there, and the servants fall into formation.

# 3. The Estate’s Services (A Tour of the Rooms)
Each room has its own atmosphere — and its own staff member waiting to assist.

---

## 3.1 Parlour Discussions
A calm morning room where Jeeves entertains light conversation, introductions, and the occasional philosophical musing.

>“Jeeves, who exactly lives in this place?”  
>“Tell me something diverting from the morning papers.”  

Expect good manners and gentle wit.

---

## 3.2 Arrangements for the Day
Enter the Study and Jeeves will draw up your daily plans with military precision (albeit politely concealed under charm).

He takes your rough intentions and hands back a neat, formal itinerary.

---

## 3.3 Matters Requiring Investigation
Here, Perkins emerges from behind a mountain of books, spectacles slightly askew, ready for analysis.

He offers:
- numbered reasoning
- comparisons
- structured reports
- and occasional academic exasperation

>“Perkins, compare ETFs and mutual funds.”  

---

## 3.4 Correspondence & Drafting
Within the Scriptorium, Miss Pennington awaits — pen lifted, posture perfect.

She can transform:
- garbled notes
- frantic bullet points
- half-formed ideas

…into dignified letters, summaries, or treatises that could plausibly be mailed from an Edwardian estate.

---

## 3.5 Records & Summaries from the Archive
A lamp flickers. Jeeves consults the Ledger of Prior Disasters™.

He retrieves:
- summaries
- previous instructions
- personal notes
- catastrophe reports (beautifully written, of course)

---

## 3.6 Her Ladyship’s Critique
The Drawing Room is dimly lit.
Lady Hawthorne looks up, eyebrow already raised.

Submit your prose at your peril.

Her reviews are:
- incisive
- elegant
- merciless
- and usually correct

>“Lady Hawthorne, your verdict on this paragraph, if you please.”

Brace yourself.

---

## 3.7 Matters Requiring the Whole Household
This is the War Room.

When the entire staff must be summoned — for example, to investigate the Mystery in the Archives — this is the mode you choose.

Jeeves coordinates.  
Pennington drafts.  
Perkins investigates.  
Hawthorne critiques.  

Chaos ensues, but in a very organized way.

---

## 3.8 Jeeves Remembers
Memory, sir?
Why yes — the Estate keeps immaculate records.

This room allows you to ask:

>“What did I tell you yesterday about my poem?”  
>“Have we ever discussed investing?”  
>“What were Perkins’s findings regarding the gnome?”  

Jeeves performs:
- keyword scoring
- domain alignment
- semantic inference
- polite recollection

All without misplacing his gloves.

---

# 4. Demonstrations of the Estate

## 4.1 Manual Demonstrations (1–8)
To reenact the Estate’s scripted dramatics:

1. Select the matching mode in the sidebar

2. Follow the `.md` script in  
`westmarch/demos_in_universe/`

These reenactments showcase agent behavior in their natural habitat.

---

## 4.2 Automated Demonstration (Demo 9 — *A Mystery in the Archives*)
Here the Estate performs a fully orchestrated drama without further instruction.

Simply:
- select **Matters Requiring the Whole Household**
- press **Run Demo 9**

Thereafter, sit back as:
- Miss Pennington uncovers clues
- Perkins investigates anomalies
- Hawthorne critiques everyone
- Jeeves attempts to maintain decorum

It is, in all respects, a thoroughly Westmarchian spectacle.

---

# 5. Conversational Etiquette

## 5.1 Tone
The staff respond well to courtesy, though they will not faint if you speak plainly.

---

## 5.2 Closure Phrases
To conclude a matter, try:
- “That will be all.”
- “Thank you, Jeeves.”
- “Much obliged.”

Jeeves recognizes these as polite dismissal.

---

## 5.3 Memory Queries
Should you ask the Estate to recall something, offering clues helps greatly:
- agent ("Perkins")
- topic ("the gnome")
- date or approximate time
- keywords

---

# 6. Troubleshooting (Polite Remedies)

### 6.1 When No Memory Is Found
Jeeves will apologise gently and ask for details.
He is, after all, only human in spirit.

---

### 6.2 When a Query Is Ambiguous
Clarify with a topic, agent, or domain:

- finance
- poetry
- investigations
- correspondence

---

### 6.3 When Demo 9 Misbehaves
Ensure:
- API keys are correctly in `.env`
- the demo is allowed to run uninterrupted
- you do not panic (Perkins will do that for you)

---

# 7. Parting Words
You now possess all knowledge needed to navigate the Westmarch Estate — its parlours, its archives, its mysteries, and its occasionally exasperated staff.

Whenever you require assistance:
- 🎩 **Jeeves** will oblige.  
- 📚 **Perkins** will analyze.  
- ✒️ **Miss Pennington** will refine.  
- 🕯️ **Lady Hawthorne** will judge.  

**The staff remain, as ever, at your service.**
