## Script

**Scene 1 — Crest & Title (0:00–0:10)**  
Visual: Westmarch crest / title card.  

🎩 Jeeves (voiceover):  
“Good day. I am Jeeves, butler of the House of Westmarch. Allow me to welcome you to the Estate, where every matter of planning, inquiry, correspondence, and critique is attended to by the household staff.”

Title text: *The House of Westmarch — A Multi-Agent Estate.*

---

**Scene 2 — The Problem (0:10–0:25)**  
Visual: simple text or slide with cluttered to-do list, email inbox, browser tabs.

🎩 Jeeves:  
“In the modern world, even the most capable individuals are besieged by endless trifles—drafting notes, researching facts, recalling yesterday’s conversations. It is quite impossible to manage alone.”

🕯️ Lady Hawthorne (quick cut):  
“Chaos, melodrama, and lost Tuesdays. The human condition.”

---

**Scene 3 — Meet the Staff (0:25–0:50)**  
Visual: screenshots or simple portraits with lower-third labels.

- 🎩 Jeeves — “Butler & Orchestrator”  
- 📚 Perkins — “Valet of Scholarly Inquiry”  
- ✒️ Miss Pennington — “Secretary & Correspondent”  
- 🕯️ Lady Hawthorne — “Critic-in-Residence”

Short lines:

📚 Perkins:  
“Research, sir! Structured, tool-assisted, and alarmingly thorough.”

✒️ Miss Pennington:  
“Give me your chaotic scraps, and I shall conjure a respectable email.”

🕯️ Lady Hawthorne:  
“I tell the truth. It stings. You’re welcome.”

---

**Scene 4 — Architecture (0:50–1:10)**  
Visual: simple diagram of Estate rooms / boxes (UI → Jeeves → agents → memory).

🎩 Jeeves (voiceover):  
“At the back of the house, the architecture is quite straightforward:  
The Streamlit interface routes everything to me. I delegate to Perkins, Miss Pennington, or Lady Hawthorne as needed, while our memory ledger keeps track of prior conversations.”

---

**Scene 5 — Demo Montage (1:10–2:00)**  
Visual: rapid cuts of real UI interactions.

- Daily planning: Jeeves suggests a day schedule.  
- Research: Perkins explains teacup psychology in bullet points.  
- Drafting: Miss Pennington turns rough notes into a tax office email.  
- Summary: Jeeves summarises the self-watering bookshelf project.  
- Critique: Lady Hawthorne reviews “O Languid Moon of Yesteryear.”  
- Gnome mystery: all agents appear briefly.  
- Memory: Jeeves recalls what was said yesterday about the poem.

**Scene 6 — Value (2:00–2:15)**  
Visual: agents gathered on screen.

🎩 Jeeves:  
“The House of Westmarch reduces cognitive strain and restores dignity to everyday tasks.”

✒️ Miss Pennington:  
“Most people are quite hopeless at writing. We try to help.”

📚 Perkins:  
“Efficiency up. Anxiety down.”

🕯️ Lady Hawthorne:  
“And at least the prose improves.”

**Scene 7 — Closing (2:15–2:30)**  
Visual: crest and GitHub URL.

🎩 Jeeves:  
“We thank you for visiting the House of Westmarch. The staff remain at your service—should you require anything, merely ring the bell.”

Fade out.
