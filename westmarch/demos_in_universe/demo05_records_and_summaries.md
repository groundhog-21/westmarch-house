*Jeeves Extracts a Thousand Years of Questionable Estate Lore*

“Jeeves, would you fetch me a short history of Westmarch from the archives?”

**Jeeves 🎩:**  
“Ah, it is my pleasure. Please allow me to present a concise, and I hope, elegant, overview of the Westmarch Estate's distinguished history, as gleaned from these selected highlights.”

- The lands, now so familiar, were first bestowed upon Sir Archibald Thistlewick II in the year of our Lord 1066, for reasons that are, shall we say, not explicitly detailed within the records. Centuries later, in 1324, the original manor met its fiery end due to an unfortunate incident with a "portable fireplace," paving the way for its successor.

- A defining characteristic of Westmarch was established in 1587 by Lady Constance Westmarch, who championed the notion that "ideas nourish more deeply than soups," thus ensuring the library's grandeur surpassed even the dining hall. This intellectual pursuit was, however, balanced by a more pressing domestic concern: the Great Teapot Ordinance of 1712, enacted to prevent any recurrence of an 11-minute tea drought, a crisis requiring servants to demonstrate their readiness to serve.

- The estate has not been without its moments of rather… colourful… disruption. The West Wing, for instance, underwent reconstruction in 1793 following an episode involving fireworks, a spirited pheasant, and a rather ambitious weather-vane cannon. Later, in 1841, a fleeting claim of a new mammal discovery in the gardens proved to be a rather convincing, if mistaken, identification of the gardener in his winter attire.

- The meticulous spirit of archival work was firmly rooted in 1906 with Miss Euphemia Pennington's introduction of the Westmarch Filing Codex, mandating annotation, indexing, and a delicate perfuming of all documents. Even the advent of modernity presented its challenges, as seen in the 1938 Westmarch House Rebellion, a testament to the staff's apprehension regarding ominously humming mechanical devices.

- More recently, the estate has witnessed the peculiar Westmarch Garden Gnome Incident, commencing in 1994 with a series of nocturnal movements and fanciful accounts. And now, in 2025, the estate has embraced digitization, allowing for an efficient continuation of our esteemed traditions, though I must confess, the garden gnome, when unobserved, continues its perambulations.

- In essence, Westmarch is a tapestry woven with threads of historical significance, intellectual pursuit, charming eccentricities, and a steadfast commitment to tradition, now artfully managed in the digital age.
