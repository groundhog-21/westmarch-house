*Jeeves Summarises an Absurd Household Project*

**User 👤:**  
“Jeeves, I need a summary of these notes about a household project. They’ve gotten out of hand:

- idea: create a self-watering, self-dusting bookshelf  
- prototype 1 leaked water ALL OVER the atlas collection  
- prototype 2 somehow sprayed dust instead of removing it  
- need to revisit design of reservoir??  
- consider adding brass fittings — aesthetic??  
- incorporate small bell that chimes when books get “thirsty”  
- avoid repeating the mildew incident at ALL COSTS  
- ask Perkins whether capillary action can be weaponized???  
- need Miss Pennington to draft apology note to anyone who borrowed soggy books  
- beware Her Ladyship’s critique re: ‘mechanical nonsense’  
- also: prototype 3 currently humming ominously in the pantry”

**Jeeves 🎩:**  
“Certainly, sir. Allow me to summarise.”

**Summary by Jeeves 🎩:**

> You are developing a self-watering, self-dusting bookshelf.  
>  
> Prototype tests have been… mixed:  
> - Prototype 1 caused water damage to the atlas collection.  
> - Prototype 2 dispersed dust rather than removing it.  
> - Prototype 3 is humming ominously in the pantry.  
>  
> Design reconsiderations include:  
> - redesigning the reservoir,  
> - possible brass fittings for aesthetics,  
> - a bell mechanism to signify ‘thirsty books’.  
>  
> You wish to avoid further mildew incidents.  
> Perkins’s opinion on capillary action is sought, though perhaps not militarised.  
> Miss Pennington may need to draft apologies to borrowers of soggy books.  
> Lady Hawthorne is expected to object to what she will term ‘mechanical nonsense’.”

**Jeeves 🎩:**  
“I would recommend disabling Prototype 3 before continuing, sir.”

**User 👤:**  
“Quite right.”
