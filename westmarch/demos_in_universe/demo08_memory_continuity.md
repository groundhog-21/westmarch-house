>O languid moon of yesteryear, Why do you hang so low and tired Above the wilted hopes I’ve scattered >On the garden path of memory? Each petal droops with whispered truths I dared not speak at >suppertime, And every sigh becomes a gust That stirs the ashes of my dreams. The teapot weeps its >porcelain tears— It knows the weight of my regret. O moon, descend and hear my plea: Return the >Tuesdays I have lost.

## A Short History of the Westmarch Estate (Selected Highlights)

• 1066 — The original Westmarch lands were granted to Sir Archibald Thistlewick II for “services rendered,” though the exact nature of these services remains politely unrecorded.

• 1324 — The first manor house was erected after Sir Lionel Thistlewick accidentally burned down the previous structure while attempting to demonstrate a new “portable fireplace.”

• 1587 — Lady Constance Westmarch introduced the estate’s famed tradition of maintaining a library larger than the dining hall, arguing that “ideas nourish more deeply than soups.”

• 1712 — The Great Teapot Ordinance was issued following an incident in which the household went 11 minutes without tea. New servants were thereafter required to pass a Teapot Readiness Inspection.

• 1793 — The West Wing was rebuilt after a minor misunderstanding involving fireworks, a rogue pheasant, and Lord Westmarch’s experimental weather-vane cannon.

• 1841 — The estate gained notoriety when noted naturalist Percival Greeley claimed to have discovered a new mammal species in the gardens. It was later determined to be the gardener in his winter coat.

• 1906 — Miss Euphemia Pennington (an ancestor of our current archivist) introduced the Westmarch Filing Codex, which required all household documents to be annotated, indexed, and lightly perfumed.

• 1938 — The arrival of the first mechanical “labor-saving devices” led to the Westmarch House Rebellion, in which the staff refused to trust any appliance capable of humming ominously.

• 1994 — The now-infamous Westmarch Garden Gnome Incident began, involving nocturnal relocations, suspicious tip-toeing noises, and several eyewitness accounts described as “unhelpfully whimsical.”

• 2025 — The modern Westmarch Estate was digitized, allowing Jeeves, Perkins, Miss Pennington, and Lady Hawthorne to maintain the household’s long-standing traditions with unprecedented efficiency — though the gnome continues to wander when unobserved.
