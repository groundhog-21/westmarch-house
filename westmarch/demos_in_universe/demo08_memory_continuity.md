# Demo 8 — Memory Demonstration  
*“What Did I Tell You Yesterday?”*

**User 👤:**  
“Jeeves, what did I tell you yesterday about my poem? I’ve quite forgotten.”

**Jeeves 🎩:**  
“Indeed, sir. Upon consulting the household’s memory ledger, I find the following relevant recollection:”

## Critique requested from Lady Hawthorne:

>TEXT: Jeeves, my good man, I have composed a short poem. Would you be so kind as to present it to Her Ladyship for her… unvarnished appraisal?”
>
>Here it is:
>
>O Languid Moon of Yesteryear
>
>O languid moon of yesteryear, Why do you hang so low and tired Above the wilted hopes I’ve scattered On the garden path of memory? Each petal droops with >whispered truths I dared not speak at suppertime, And every sigh becomes a gust That stirs the ashes of my dreams. The teapot weeps its porcelain tears— It >knows the weight of my regret. O moon, descend and hear my plea: Return the Tuesdays I have lost.

**Lady Hawthorne 🕯️:**
>CRITIQUE: Verdict: Ah, poetry at the breakfast table—how tastefully Victorian. One is rarely presented with melancholia so whimsically steeped in porcelain >and regret. Let us proceed, scalpel in gloved hand.
>
>Critique:
>
>Atmospheric Consistency: Your lunar lamentation immerses us in a wistful, delicate gloom, freshly misted with the fragrance of nocturnal nostalgia. You >sustain an appealingly antique sensibility; one can almost hear the silver spoons clinking in the background.
>
>Imagery: The “garden path of memory” and “petal droops with whispered truths” evoke pleasingly tactile melancholy. However, the “teapot weeps its porcelain >tears” tips teeteringly into Edwardian whimsy—charming if intentional, perilous if not.
>
>Originality of Metaphor: While moon musings and withered hopes are familiar courtiers at poetry’s court, “return the Tuesdays I have lost” rings out with >quietly eccentric originality, suggesting regret both specific and ineffable.
>
>Tonality and Voice: The voice is consistent—wistful, gently self-mocking, and genteel in its angst. Yet, lines such as “I dared not speak at suppertime,” >while evocative, verge on Downtonian melodrama. A touch less supper-club sorrow, perhaps.
>
>Structure and Flow: The poem flows gracefully, with enjambment and phrasing that do not trip the reader. Still, some lines—such as “Above the wilted hopes >I’ve scattered / On the garden path of memory”—labour a little beneath the weight of abstraction.
>
>Suggestions:
>
>Consider tightening your metaphors: a single, striking image often lingers longer than a procession of gentle sighs.
>Resist overindulging in Victorian melancholia; a whiff is alluring, a deluge risks making the drawing room musty.
>“The teapot weeps its porcelain tears”—if you mean to be whimsically surreal, press further, or else trim the flourish.
>Let “the Tuesdays I have lost” stand as the crown jewel; it is your poem’s most distinctive moment—trust in its quiet strangeness.
>In sum, your work wafts delicately through the halls of gentle regret—one might almost say, it is the perfect accompaniment to over-steeped Earl Grey and >faint reminiscence.
>
>I await your next poetic tea service with anticipation. Do take heart—even flawed work may yet be redeemed, especially over an impeccable scone.
>
>If you desire a fuller account or further inquiry, I remain entirely at your disposal.”

**User 👤:**  
“Thank you, Jeeves.”

**Jeeves 🎩:**  
“Indeed, sir. Miss Pennington and I remain prepared to recover any stray reflections.”
