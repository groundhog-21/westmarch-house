# Demo 8 — Memory Demonstration  
*“What Did I Tell You Yesterday?”*

**User 👤:**  
“Jeeves, what did I tell you yesterday about my poem? I’ve quite forgotten.”

**Jeeves 🎩:**  
“Yesterday, sir, you informed the household regarding *‘O Languid Moon of Yesteryear’* that it was intended to evoke longing for lost Tuesdays, the emotional weight of porcelain, and the fatigue of celestial bodies. I recorded these remarks in the ledger.”

**User 👤:**  
“And what did Lady Hawthorne say?”

**Jeeves 🎩:**  
“She described it as ‘an ambitious but structurally exhausted work where moon, teapot, and narrator compete for the reader’s pity.’”

**Lady Hawthorne 🕯️:**  
“I stand by it.”

**User 👤:**  
“And Miss Pennington?”

**Jeeves 🎩:**  
“Miss Pennington noted that your imagery was vivid but turbulent, and that she stood ready to assist with revisions.”

**Miss Pennington ✒️:**  
“Always, sir.”

**User 👤:**  
“Thank you, Jeeves.”

**Jeeves 🎩:**  
“A pleasure, sir. The memory ledger exists precisely for such occasions.”
