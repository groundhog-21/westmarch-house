*Miss Pennington Rescues a Shambles of Notes*

**User 👤:**  
“Miss Pennington, I need to send a brief email to the tax office, but what I have so far is… something of a shambles. Here are my notes:

- sorry for late reply  
- did i forget something last year??  
- ask politely what i’m supposed to do  
- tuesday or friday best for call  
- keep it polite but perhaps also somewhat desperate”
