## **Full Script**

### **📜 Scene 1 — The Discovery**

**✒️ Pennington:**  
“Sir, while preparing the monthly archival index, I discovered a parchment filed under *‘Agricultural Affairs → Troublingly Damp Potatoes’.* A most improbable classification.”

**👤 User:**  
“What sort of parchment is it?”

**✒️ Pennington:**  
“A brittle sheet labelled only:  
**‘UNEXPLAINED RATTLING — DO NOT DISTURB.’**  
Naturally, I disturbed it at once.”

**🎩 Jeeves:**  
“Most intriguing. I shall summon Perkins.”

---

### **🔍 Scene 2 — Perkins Begins the Investigation**

**📚 Perkins:**  
“A misfiled parchment with a dire warning. Excellent. Miss Pennington: hand it over. I shall examine the metadata immediately.”

**✒️ Pennington:**  
“The ink trembles — as though the writer’s hand shook with dread.”

**📚 Perkins:**  
“Then let us begin **Parallel Analysis Round 1**.”

---

### **🌀 Scene 3 — Parallel Agents Activated**

**📚 Perkins (Analysis Track):**  
“I will analyze ink density, tremor frequency, and crumb distribution.”

**✒️ Pennington (Documentation Track):**  
“I shall prepare an official Discrepancy Report.”

**🎩 Jeeves:**  
“Very good. I shall keep the process orderly.”

---

### **🧰 Scene 4 — Custom Tool Invocation**

**Tool:** *Archival Metadata Scrutinizer v3.2*  
(A brass instrument known for its judgmental beeping.)

**📚 Perkins:**  
“Jeeves, activate the **Archival Metadata Scrutinizer**, if you please.”

**🧰 Tool Output:**  
> *‘Ink dated 1847.  
> Tremor frequency: pronounced.  
> Foreign substances: biscuit crumbs (0.7 g).  
> Ambient dread: moderate.’*

**📚 Perkins:**  
“As expected. Biscuit-fear correlation remains strong.”

### **🕯️ Scene 5 — Lady Hawthorne Arrives to Mock Everyone**

**🕯️ Hawthorne:**  
“My dears, if you require a device to tell you your papers are dusty and frightened, perhaps we should install cushions in the archives to prevent fainting.”

**📚 Perkins:**  
“I assure Your Ladyship, this is legitimate research.”

**🕯️ Hawthorne:**  
“Perkins, the only legitimate research is into how quickly I can leave this conversation.”

---

### **🔁 Scene 6 — Investigation Loop 2**

**📚 Perkins:**  
“The metadata envelope for 1847, if you please, Jeeves.”

**🎩 Jeeves:**  
“At once, sir.”

**📚 Perkins:**  
“Aha! A record of a *rattling chest* kept in the Westmarch cellar, described only as ‘noisy,’ ‘ominous,’ and ‘containing a turnip of considerable menace.’”

---

### **🔔 Scene 7 — Long-Running Pause/Resume Operation**

*A sudden metallic **CLANG** echoes through the archives.*

**🎩 Jeeves:**  
“Oh dear. That would be the Automated Card Catalogue Carousel. It occasionally unmoors itself.”

**👤 User:**  
“Shall we pause the investigation until the noise settles?”

**🎩 Jeeves:**  
“Very prudent, sir.  
**Pausing investigation…**  
…  
…  
**Resuming investigation now.**”

---

### **🕵️ Scene 8 — Resolution**

**📚 Perkins:**  
“The rattling parchment refers to the chest in the cellar — the one containing only a cracked vase, a spoon, and a turnip that dried into a rather menacing shape.”

**✒️ Pennington:**  
“In other words: harmless.”

**🎩 Jeeves:**  
“Precisely. And at some point, a startled archivist abandoned their post and misfiled the warning with the potatoes.”

**👤 User:**  
“So the mystery is solved?”

**🎩 Jeeves:**  
“Entirely, sir.”

### **📜 Scene 9 — Miss Pennington’s Final Report**

**✒️ Pennington:**  
> **Archival Mystery Report – Final Findings**  
>  
> **Cause:** Misfiled warning parchment from 1847.  
> **Custom Tool Used:** Archival Metadata Scrutinizer v3.2.  
> **Long-Running Interruption:** Card Catalogue Carousel incident.  
> **Contributing Factors:** Biscuit crumbs, trembling handwriting, potato subdirectory error.  
> **Resolution:** Reclassified under *‘Persistent Noises.’*  
> **Recommendation:** Reduce biscuit consumption in archives; reconsider the Carousel’s freedom of movement.

### **🕯️ Scene 10 — Lady Hawthorne’s Final Commentary**

**🕯️ Hawthorne:**  
“Well, you’ve successfully wasted a morning identifying a frightened turnip. I suppose congratulations are in order. Now if you’ll excuse me, the ficus is behaving suspiciously again.”
