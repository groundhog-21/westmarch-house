# Demo 8 — Memory Demonstration  
*“What Did I Tell You Yesterday?”*

**User 👤:**  
“Jeeves, what did I tell you yesterday about my poem? I’ve quite forgotten.”

**Jeeves 🎩:**  
“Indeed, sir. Upon consulting the household’s memory ledger, I find the following relevant recollection:”

>Critique requested from Lady Hawthorne:
>
>TEXT: Jeeves, my good man, I have composed a short poem. Would you be so kind as to present it to Her Ladyship for her… unvarnished appraisal?”
>
>Here it is:
>
>O Languid Moon of Yesteryear
>
>O languid moon of yesteryear, Why do you hang so low and tired Above the wilted hopes I’ve scattered On the garden path of memory? Each petal droops with >whispered truths I dared not speak at suppertime, And every sigh becomes a gust That stirs the ashes of my dreams. The teapot weeps its porcelain tears— It >knows the weight of my regret. O moon, descend and hear my plea: Return the Tuesdays I have lost.

**Lady Hawthorne 🕯️:**
>CRITIQUE: VERDICT: Brooding and evocative, your poem summons the ghosts of lost days with an admirable melancholy, though it leans perilously on familiar >imagery (drooping petals and tired moons are rather well-trod by now, my dear). The domestic note of the weeping teapot is inspired, yet risks tottering into >whimsy without firmer grounding. Prune your metaphors and seek fresher turns of phrase, and your lamentations may soon shine with singular lustre.
>
>Take heart: even wilted hopes may yield a most fragrant verse in the end.

**Jeeves 🎩:** 
“If you desire a fuller account or further inquiry, I remain entirely at your disposal.”

**User 👤:**  
“Thank you, Jeeves.”

**Jeeves 🎩:**  
“Indeed, sir. Miss Pennington and I remain prepared to recover any stray reflections.”
