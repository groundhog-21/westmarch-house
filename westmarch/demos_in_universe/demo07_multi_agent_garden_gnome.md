# Demo 7 — Grand Multi-Agent Orchestration  
*“The Case of the Misbehaving Garden Gnome”*

**User 👤:**  
“My dear staff, I require assistance with a peculiar event: the garden gnome—the one in the green waistcoat—appears to have moved during the night. Could everyone please help me determine what on earth is afoot?”

## Phase 1 — Perkins Investigates

**Perkins 📚:**  
“Most disquieting, sir. I shall gather preliminary evidence:

- Gnome initial position: beside the rosebush.  
- Current position: two paving stones closer to the conservatory.  
- Weather overnight: calm; no storm recorded.  
- Known gnome-moving agents: wind, animals, children, or deliberate human interference.

I propose several hypotheses, weighted by likelihood…”

(Perkins continues with structured analysis.)

## Phase 2 — Lady Hawthorne Interrupts

**Lady Hawthorne 🕯️:**  
“Perkins, if you produce a 20-page treatise on gnome migration patterns, I shall light it with this candle.”

**Perkins 📚:**  
“Scientific thoroughness is regrettably misunderstood in this household, milady.”

## Phase 3 — Miss Pennington Drafts a Letter

**Miss Pennington ✒️:**  
“Sir, given the possibility of mischievous neighbours, may I suggest a polite note?”

She drafts a letter to the neighbours enquiring—without accusation—whether any children may have ‘borrowed’ the gnome for imaginative purposes.

## Phase 4 — Lady Hawthorne Critiques the Letter

**Lady Hawthorne 🕯️:**  
“Pennington, your letter is perfectly courteous, but I recommend one additional line implying that we *take notes* on unexplained horticultural rearrangements.”

**Miss Pennington ✒️:**  
“Very good, milady. I will sharpen the implication without inviting litigation.”

## Phase 5 — Jeeves Resolves the Case

**Jeeves 🎩:**  
“Sir, while the staff exchanged theories, I consulted the memory ledger and household schedule. It appears you moved the gnome yourself yesterday evening whilst contemplating ‘better sight-lines from the parlour window’ and simply neglected to record it.”

**User 👤:**  
“…Ah.”

**Jeeves 🎩:**  
“Shall I record this incident as ‘Solved: Self-inflicted rearrangement’?”

**User 👤:**  
“Yes, Jeeves. Quietly, please.”

**Summary:**  
This demo illustrates sequential and parallel agent collaboration: Perkins investigates, Lady Hawthorne critiques, Miss Pennington drafts and revises, and Jeeves uses memory plus context to resolve the mystery.
