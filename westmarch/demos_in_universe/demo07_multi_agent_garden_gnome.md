# Demo 7 — Grand Multi-Agent Orchestration  
*“The Case of the Misbehaving Garden Gnome”*

**User 👤:**  
“My dear staff, I require assistance with a peculiar event: the garden gnome—the one in the green waistcoat—appears to have moved during the night. Could everyone please help me determine what on earth is afoot?”

**Jeeves 🎩:**
“If I may, Sir, Miss Pennington has just completed her archival summary of our investigations into the gnome's rather unexpected peregrination.”

**Miss Pennington ✒️:**
“It is with a gentle sense of amusement that I record the recent deliberations concerning our spirited garden gnome. Perkins, ever diligent, conducted an initial inquiry, observing that the gnome had indeed been displaced and musing, “Given the absence of other disturbances, it is most probable that a combination of a strong overnight gust of wind, or perhaps a nocturnal creature, caused the gnome to shift.” Lady Hawthorne, with her characteristic wit, suggested that further thoroughness might be found if Perkins considered “any footprints, pawprints, or odd traces” to enrich his findings.

Following this, I drafted a note to our neighbours, extending a warm invitation for any observations regarding the gnome's "nocturnal wanderings." Lady Hawthorne, in her critique, recommended a more personal touch, advising a greeting that would offer “a more neighbourly touch.” Consequently, I have revised the letter to include specific addresses for our esteemed neighbours.”

>Dear Mrs. Bromley, Mr. Chivers, and esteemed neighbours,
>
>We trust this note finds you in good spirits. A most peculiar occurrence has transpired at Westmarch House overnight concerning our garden gnome, the one >attired in the green waistcoat. It seems he has embarked on an unscheduled excursion from his customary position.
>
>We would be most appreciative if any of you chanced to witness unusual activity or possess insight into his nocturnal meanderings.
>
>Warmest regards,
>
>Miss Pennington

**Jeeves 🎩:**
“One trusts this will prove informative, Sir.”

**User 👤:**  
“My thanks, good man, to you and all of the staff.”

**Jeeves 🎩:**
“Indeed, sir. If another garden ornament develops ambitions of nocturnal adventure, we shall of course investigate with all due diligence.“

**Summary:**  
This demo illustrates the whole household orchestration workflow: Perkins performs a concise investigation, Lady Hawthorne provides refined critique twice, Miss Pennington drafts and revises, and Jeeves presents the final archival summary with dignified restraint.
