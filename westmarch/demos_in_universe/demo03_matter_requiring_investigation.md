# Demo 3 — Matters Requiring Investigation  
*Teacup Psychology by Perkins*

**User 👤:**  
“Perkins, I require you to investigate something. What does it say about a person’s psyche if they always choose the smallest teacup available?”

**Perkins 📚:**  
“Most intriguing, sir. Allow me to present a structured analysis:

1. **Symbolic Preference for Restraint**  
   Choosing the smallest teacup may indicate an affinity for moderation and controlled indulgence.

2. **Subconscious Desire for Delicacy**  
   Some individuals favour small vessels as they associate them with precision, refinement, or gentility.

3. **Avoidance of Overcommitment**  
   A smaller volume reduces the chance of overconsumption—or of conversation lasting excessively long.

4. **Aesthetic Romanticism**  
   The smallest cup is often the prettiest, sir. This factor should not be overlooked.

5. **Hedonic Pacing**  
   Smaller cups empty more quickly, allowing for more frequent refilling—a potentially ritualistic behaviour.

If you wish, sir, I can gather comparative data from cultural tea customs.”

**Perkins 📚:**  
“As you wish, sir. Most stimulating.”
