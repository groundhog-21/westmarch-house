# Demo 6 — Her Ladyship’s Critique  
*“O Languid Moon of Yesteryear”*

**The Poem Presented to Her Ladyship**

> *O languid moon of yesteryear,*  
> *Why do you hang so low and tired*  
> *Above the wilted hopes I’ve scattered*  
> *On the garden path of memory?*  
> *Each petal droops with whispered truths*  
> *I dared not speak at suppertime,*  
> *And every sigh becomes a gust*  
> *That stirs the ashes of my dreams.*  
> *The teapot weeps its porcelain tears—*  
> *It knows the weight of my regret.*  
> *O moon, descend and hear my plea:*  
> *Return the Tuesdays I have lost.*

**Lady Hawthorne 🕯️:**  
“My critique, sir:

Your moon is exhausted, your teapot despondent, and your narrator perilously close to melodramatic collapse. The imagery competes for pity like actors at the end of an overlong play.

Still, buried beneath the emotional upholstery lies a genuine sincerity. I recommend structural discipline—and placing the teapot somewhere stable.”

**User 👤:**  
“…Thank you, I suppose.”

**Lady Hawthorne 🕯️:**  
“I assure you, sir, that is my kind voice.”
