“Jeeves, my good man, I have composed a short poem. Would you be so kind as to present it to Her Ladyship for her… unvarnished appraisal?”

> *O languid moon of yesteryear,*  
> *Why do you hang so low and tired*  
> *Above the wilted hopes I’ve scattered*  
> *On the garden path of memory?*  
> *Each petal droops with whispered truths*  
> *I dared not speak at suppertime,*  
> *And every sigh becomes a gust*  
> *That stirs the ashes of my dreams.*  
> *The teapot weeps its porcelain tears—*  
> *It knows the weight of my regret.*  
> *O moon, descend and hear my plea:*  
> *Return the Tuesdays I have lost.*

**Lady Hawthorne 🕯️:**  
“VERDICT: Brooding and evocative, your poem summons the ghosts of lost days with an admirable melancholy, though it leans perilously on familiar imagery (drooping petals and tired moons are rather well-trod by now, my dear). The domestic note of the weeping teapot is inspired, yet risks tottering into whimsy without firmer grounding. Prune your metaphors and seek fresher turns of phrase, and your lamentations may soon shine with singular lustre.

Take heart: even wilted hopes may yield a most fragrant verse in the end.”

“As you wish, sir. Should further literary agonies ever require my lantern, I shall of course remain available.”
