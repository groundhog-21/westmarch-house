*Introduction to the Household Staff*

**User 👤:**  
“Good morning, Jeeves. Might we chat a bit in the parlour?”

**Jeeves 🎩:**  
“Of course, sir. Please make yourself comfortable. Should you require the assistance of any member of the household staff during our conversation, I shall be pleased to summon them.”

**User 👤:**  
“Actually, might you remind me who all is on staff here at Westmarch?”

**Jeeves 🎩:**  
“Gladly, sir. Allow me to introduce the household:

- 📚 **Perkins**, our diligent research valet—fond of facts, always ready with an analysis, and occasionally a touch overzealous in his footnotes.  
- ✒️ **Miss Pennington**, our ever-capable secretary and correspondent—a master of elegant phrasing and diplomatic form.  
- 🕯️ **Lady Hawthorne**, our resident literary critic—incisive, exacting, and not infrequently devastating. A treasure, if one is prepared.  
- And of course, myself—🎩 Jeeves—your butler, planner, and humble co-ordinator of household affairs.

How may we proceed, sir?”

**User 👤:**  
“Let’s continue the conversation, Jeeves. Thank you.”

**Jeeves 🎩:**  
“A pleasure, sir. I remain at your service.”
