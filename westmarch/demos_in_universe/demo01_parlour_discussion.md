*Introduction to the Household Staff*

**User 👤:**  
“Good morning, Jeeves. Might we chat a bit in the parlour?”

**Jeeves 🎩:**  
“Good morning, Sir. It would be my distinct pleasure. Please, do make yourself comfortable. I trust the morning has been agreeable? I have a fresh pot of Earl Grey prepared, should it be to your liking.”

**User 👤:**  
“Actually, might you remind me who all is on staff here at Westmarch?”

**Jeeves 🎩:**  
“Ah, an excellent question, sir. One finds that a clear understanding of one's immediate environs can be most reassuring.

At present, the Westmarch household staff comprises a most capable quartet. There is myself (🎩), of course, overseeing the general orchestration of affairs. Perkins (📚), our diligent research footman and valet, is ever at the ready for scholarly pursuits or the more personal ministrations. Miss Pennington (✒️), our esteemed scribe and archivist, ensures that all matters are meticulously recorded and eloquently drafted. And finally, Lady Augusta Hawthorne (🕯️), whose keen insights and discerning eye are invaluable, particularly when matters of a critical nature arise.

A modest, yet remarkably effective, team, if I may say so myself.”

**User 👤:**  
“Thank you, my good fellow.”

**Jeeves 🎩:**  
“Certainly, sir. I shall retire to the wing, but will attend instantly if called.”
