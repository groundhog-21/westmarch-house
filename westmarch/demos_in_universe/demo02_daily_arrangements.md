# Demo 2 — Arrangements for the Day  
*Daily Planning with Jeeves*

**User 👤:**  
“Jeeves, I’d like to plan my day, if you’d be so good.”

**Jeeves 🎩:**  
“Certainly, sir. May I ask what engagements, tasks, or priorities you already have in mind for today?”

**User 👤:**  
“I should like to accomplish three things:

- write a short note I’ve been putting off,  
- continue reading my book,  
- and go for a brisk walk.”

**Jeeves 🎩:**  
“Very good, sir. Here is a suggested agenda:

**Morning**  
- Attend first to the note you’ve been postponing; a fresh mind expedites such work.  
- A short break with a light refreshment thereafter.

**Afternoon**  
- Resume your book. I recommend a fixed interval—say 45 minutes—followed by a brief pause for reflection.

**Evening**  
- A brisk walk before supper. The air should be agreeable by then and conducive to clarity.

If you prefer alternative timings, I shall revise accordingly.”

**User 👤:**  
“This will do nicely.”

**Jeeves 🎩:**  
“A pleasure, sir.”
