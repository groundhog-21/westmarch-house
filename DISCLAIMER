This repository is part of a Kaggle Agents Intensive Capstone Project
submission.

This is a fictional, gamified multi-agent demonstration created for
illustrative and educational purposes.

All characters herein—Jeeves, Perkins, Miss Pennington, Lady Hawthorne,
and any additional members of the Estate—are entirely fictional and
should not be interpreted as real individuals, advisors, or authorities
of any sort.
Any resemblance to real persons, living or deceased, is wholly unintended
and purely coincidental.

Lady Hawthorne, in particular, must not be mistaken for an actual
literary authority, though she would be delighted if you did so.
